London Houses Prices Data Story in Tableau

This Tableau dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of NW3, one of London’s most desirable postcodes, covering real estate trends, sales activity, affordability, and socioeconomic factors. Through interactive visualizations, the project explores whether NW3 truly offers the best of both worlds—combining affluence, accessibility, and quality of life while remaining relatively affordable compared to other prime London districts.

Key Insights:

- Real Estate Market: NW3 remains one of London's top-selling districts, with stable price growth over the years.
- Affordability: Compared to high-end areas like Chelsea and Kensington, NW3 is ~30% more affordable per sqm.
- Sales Trends: NW3 consistently attracts buyers, even during market downturns like the 2008 financial crisis.
- Quality of Life: Low deprivation index, strong transport links, and a balance of urban and suburban living.
